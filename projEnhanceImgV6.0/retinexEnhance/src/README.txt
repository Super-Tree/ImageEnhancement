# OVERVIEW

Given an image f, the algorithm applies the Multiscale Retinex with color restoration, based on the work of J.J. Jobson, Z. Rahman and G. A. Woodell 
" A Multiscale Retinex for Bridging the Gap between Color Images and the Human Observation of Scenes" in IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, vol. 6(7) pp. 965-976, 1997.

# REQUIREMENTS

The code is written in  C, the code requires getopt.h and should compile on any system with a C compiler.

The libpng header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

The fftw3 header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.fftw.org/

# COMPILATION

Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`.

# USAGE

MSR_original [-S S] [-L,L] [-M M] [-H H] [-N N] [-l l] [-R R]  input  MSR_rgb  MSR_gray
	-S  S	number of scales. 
		if scales number is 1 then low scale is the scale to use.
		If the number of scales is 2 then low and medium scales are used 
		(Default: 3)
	-L  L	Low scale (Default: 15)
	-M  M	Medium scale (Default: 80)
	-H  H	High scale (Default: 250)
	-N  N	If 0 final 'canonical' gain/offset; if 1 with final simplest color
		balance (Default: 1)
	-l  l	percentage of saturation on the left (simplest color balance) (Default:1)
	-R  R	percentage  of saturation on the right (simplest color balance) 
		(Default: 1)
	input	 input file
	MSR_rgb	 Multiscale retinex on rgb channels
	MSR_gray	 Multiscale retinex on the gray
